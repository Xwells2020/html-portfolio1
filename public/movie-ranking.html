<h1>The Best Movies According to Xavier</h1>
<h2>My Top 5 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Mask</h3>
<p>Can watch still to this day, gives a funny spin on the personality and charisma we hold within vs the character we display to the world normally</p>

<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>Saw it 3 times in theaters, enough said.</p>

<h3>Dr. Strange</h3>
<p>Gives subliminal info on the spiritual powers within, hilarious script and actors, as well displays incredible visuals and cinematic artwork production</p>

<h3>Den Of Theives</h3>
<p>A creative spin on the classic Heat that gives a lot of action and plot twist</p>

<h3>Superbad</h3>
<p>Takes me back to my wonder years when spending the night with a friend and going out to a party was life</p>
